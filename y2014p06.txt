THERE NEVER WAS NO MAN NOWHERE SO VIRTUOUS.
AXE YA EX WHAT TALKS IN TONGUES, SAY "NEVER MO NEITHER ME".
I HAVEN'T NEVER OWED NOTHING TO NO ONE.
BADGES? WE AIN'T GOT NO BADGES.
THIS IS A PERFECTLY POSITIVE SENTENCE.
I CAN'T GET NO, NO, NO, NO, HEY, HEY, HEY, NO SATISFACTION!
IT WOULDN'T BE INACCURATE TO ASSUME I COULDN'T SAY THAT I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S NOT.
